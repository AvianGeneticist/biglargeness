 Adds a bunch of overscaled outfits to Naev.

If you're using my [Fractal Carriers](https://github.com/AvianGeneticist/fractalcarrier) plugin, install the [Big Fractals patch](https://github.com/AvianGeneticist/aabigfractals); it solves some tech list conflicts between the two plugins and adds a mega bay for the subcarriers.
