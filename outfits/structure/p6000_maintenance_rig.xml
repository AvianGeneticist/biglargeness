  <description>During the development of newer auxiliary processors for large ships and carriers, attempts were made to include self-contained power cells to offset the energy cost of the new CPUs. Over time, this evolved into a full power system being included with newer generation processors, including a small battery. The necessity of compactness means that the system is heavier than the sum of its parts.</description>
